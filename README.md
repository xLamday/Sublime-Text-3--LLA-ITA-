This repository was created for those who wants the italian translation of Sublime Text 3

Follow these steps in order to get the italian translation:

- Go to your Roaming folder
- Search for Sublime Text 3, and go for "Packages" and "LocalizedMenu"
- Into "locale" folder, drag and drop the folder "it"
- Into "Menu" folder, drag and drop the folders which contain numbers

Those are all the steps. Now you have Sublime Text 3 with italian translation
